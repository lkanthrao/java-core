            Alternatively, the Book constructor could take all the parameters corresponding to the Book fields,
            but this would mean that you must deal again with many parameters to be set in the right order when you
            call the Book constructor from the Builderâ€™s build method. Mixing up parameters of the same type is one of
            the potential issues developers try to avoid by implementing the Builder pattern.
